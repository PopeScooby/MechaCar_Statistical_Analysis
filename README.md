## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### Looking at the linear regression model and summary for the MechaCars dataset there are several things we can tell several things...

 - The variables/coefficients that provided a non-random amount of variance and signifigant impact on mpg were "Vehicle Length" and "Ground Clearance".
 - Looking at the p-values for the signifigant variables we can see that they are both below the signifigance level of .05. This means that the slope of the linear model is not zero and we can reject our null hypothesis.
 - By looking at the R-squared value we can see that 71% of the variability of mpg is explained by the model. This means that the model can effectively predict the mpg of the car prototypes.
